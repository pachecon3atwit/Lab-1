#  Soccer Stats API (FastAPI) ⚽

## Introduction

The Soccer Stats API is a beginner-friendly web service built using **FastAPI**. It simulates a simple soccer statistics system with multiple endpoints that provide and accept data about players, teams, stadiums, and matches. This project helped me learn the structure and behavior of APIs, including how to handle different types of routes and data inputs.

## Description

This API was developed to explore how web services work using FastAPI. The focus was on learning by doing—specifically creating routes with path and query parameters, accepting JSON data via POST requests, and returning structured responses. While the API is not connected to a real database, it serves as a useful model for how soccer-related data could be handled.

The project includes a minimum of 10 different routes, covering:

- Simple Route
- Query String Route
- Path Route
- JSON body submission using `BaseModel`

It was built out of personal interest in soccer and backend development, and serves as a functional demonstration of basic FastAPI skills, powered by Uvicorn as the server.

## Design

The API is structured in a single Python file (`main.py`) using FastAPI. It includes:

- `GET` routes for retrieving data using path parameters and query strings.
- `POST` routes to demonstrate accepting and validating JSON bodies.
- Pydantic models to ensure request data is structured correctly.
- Built-in documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc, automatically generated by FastAPI.

Each route is designed to simulate realistic soccer-related features like registering players, submitting match scores, and getting standings or stadium info.

## Usage & How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

### Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pachecon3atwit/Lab-1.git
   cd Lab-1 
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment (using PyCharm Community Edition):**

   This project uses a virtual environment managed by PyCharm. When you open the project in PyCharm, it automatically sets up and uses a virtual environment. Make sure you've selected the correct Python interpreter under:

   `File` → `Settings` → `Project: Lab-1` → `Python Interpreter`

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

4. **Run the API server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --reload 
   ```

5. **Access the interactive documentation:**
   - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/docs]
   - ReDoc: [http://localhost:8080/redoc]

### Example Endpoints

- `GET /` – Home route
- `GET /player_goals?name=Messi&goals=30`
- `GET /team_info/Barcelona`
- `GET /standings?league=LaLiga&top=5`
- `POST /register_player` – Accepts JSON: `{ "name": "Messi", "position": "Forward" }`
- `POST /submit_match` – Accepts JSON: `{ "home_team": "Barcelona", "away_team": "Madrid", "home_score": 2, "away_score": 1 }`

These routes show how to retrieve and submit data in a structured, RESTful format.
